Lots of stop watches have the concept of "laps" which allow you to store sequential runnings of the stopwatch.

You should add a third button called "Lap" that stores the current value of the timer and resets it to 0.

You should implement a list of the historical laps and times of the stopwatch.

Notes:

- If the stopwatch is running when "Lap" is pressed, it should keep running.
- If the stopwatch isn't running when "Lap" is pressed then it should reset and not start.
