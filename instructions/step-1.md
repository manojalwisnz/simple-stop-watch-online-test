## Step 1

Your task is to create a stop watch that increments by whole seconds.

Your application should have

- A start/pause button
- A reset button
- A display containing the currently counted stopwatch time

The start button should start the timer from what ever it is currently at, and should switch to a "pause" button when the timer is actively running.

The reset button should wipe the current counter and reset the value to 0.
