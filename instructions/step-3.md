High performance (and even low performance) atheletes sometimes want to know how they are currently performing to the average. You should add a few more customization option to the display:

- You should show the current average of all of the completed laps
- The currently running time should change colors to reflect whether you are currently ahead of time (green if current time is less than average) or behind in time (red if current time is greater than the average)
- There should be a button to clear the current list of times.
